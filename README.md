# ASD-Diagnose-with-GNNs

This repository includes four GNN models of ASD Diagnose: GCN, GAT, ChebyNet and graphSAGE, two plotting codes and the MWU test code. The Python file ending with "+loss" is the model that introduces the Wasserstein Graph Distance.

Both CPU and GPU environments are supported.

## Requirements

Recommended version:

* **Python**: python 3.7 
* **torch**: torch 1.12.0
